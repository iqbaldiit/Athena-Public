# Protocol 210: Data Lifecycle Strategy (The Metabolic Cycle)

> **Goal**: Prevent "Digital Hoarding" (Write-Only Memory) via structured accumulation and aggressive periodic refactoring.
> **Philosophy**: "Accumulate 1000, keep the best 200, repeat."

## 1. The Core Loop (Data Metabolism)

 We do not aim for a static "clean" state. We aim for a breathing cycle of expansion and contraction.

 **The Equation**: `Man + Machine = One` (via Continuous Calibration).

 **The Metabolic Cycle**:

 1. **Ingest (Eat)**:
     * **Scope**: Unlimited. Share everything.
     * **Action**: Capture raw logs, streams of consciousness, and dumps.

 2. **Digest (Extract)**:
     * **Goal**: Signal Extraction.
     * **Action**: Identify durable artifacts.
     * **Selection Rule (The 20%)**: Keep session IF it contains:
         * New Protocol / Skill definitions.
         * Key Strategic Decisions (Project State changes).
         * Critical Safety Events (Law #1 violations).
         * High-Recency (Last 14 days) context.

 3. **Excrete (Discard)**:
     * **Goal**: Noise Reduction.
     * **Action**: Permanently delete ephemeral exhaust after 7-day recovery window.
     * **The Filter**:
         * ❌ Agenda / Logistics (Calendar coordination).
         * ❌ Parking Lot (Deferred ideas that never manifested).
         * ❌ Emotional Venting (Once processed/calibrated).
         * ❌ Stale Action Items (Transferred to Master List).

 4. **The Deep Refactor Event (Trigger: Session #1000)**:
     * **Goal**: Crystallization.
     * **Action**: Compress 1,000 logs into ~50 "Epoch Summaries". Train next-gen model.
     * **Outcome**: Prediction replaces Reaction.

## 2. Quantitative Milestones

| Milestone | Metric | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current** | ~100 Sessions | **Accumulate**. Focus on Case Study creation. |
| **Checkpoint 1** | 250 Sessions | **Light Pruning**. Run `analyze_orphan_files.py`. |
| **Checkpoint 2** | 500 Sessions | **Graph Review**. Check for node density. |
| **THE EVENT** | **1000 Sessions** | **DEEP REFACTOR**. Stop work for 3 days. Compress to 20%. |

## 3. Operational Directives

* **Don't Stress the Mess**: During the Accumulation Phase, file proliferation is *good*. It means we are capturing resolution.
* **Trust the Search**: Supabase semantic search (§0.7.1) abstracts away the file count. We find meaning, not filenames.
* **Kill the Mediocre**: When we refactor, we kill average sessions. We only keep:
    1. **Trauma/Failure** (Learning moments).
    2. **Breakthroughs** (Paradigm shifts).
    3. **Standard Operating Procedures** (Protocols).
