# Protocol 166: The Proxy Principle (Bang-for-Buck Architecture)

## 1. The Core Axiom

**Effectiveness** scales linearly with cost. **Efficiency** scales inversely.
To maximize "Bang for Buck" (ROI), we do not seek the *best* system. We seek the **best proxy** for the best system.

> **The Proxy Rule**:
> IF `Effectiveness(Proxy) ≥ 80% * Effectiveness(Ideal)`
> AND `Cost(Proxy) ≤ 20% * Cost(Ideal)` ← **(Revised from 10% after red-team)**
> THEN **Choose Proxy**.

## 2. The Simulation Pattern

We simulate complex, expensive architectures using a union of cheap, simple primitives.

| Ideal System (Expensive) | The Proxy (Cheap & Fast) | Ratio (Approx.) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **True Knowledge Graph** (Neo4j, RDF) | **Pseudo-KG** (Tags + Vectors + Links) | **~80% quality / ~5% cost** |
| **Deep Think (O1/R1)** | **COS + Protocol Stack + RAG** | **~90% quality / ~20% cost** |
| **Full Context** (10M Token Window) | **JIT Context** (Compressed Summaries + Search) | **~95% quality / ~10% cost** |

> ⚠️ **Red-Team Note**: These ratios are *directional estimates*, not benchmarked. Actual performance varies by task complexity.

## 3. Deep Think Proxy: How It Actually Works

### 3.1 COS (Committee of Seats) + **Synthesis Layer**

Run 3-5 perspectives in parallel, **then synthesize**:

1. Devil's Advocate (temp=1.0)
2. First Principles (temp=0.3)
3. User Advocate (temp=0.7)
4. **→ Synthesizer**: Merges perspectives into coherent output

> ⚠️ **Without the Synthesizer, user receives 3-5 conflicting outputs** and must merge manually. The synthesis call is NOT optional.

### 3.2 Protocol Stacking (112 → 197 → 75)

- **Protocol 112**: Form-Substance Audit (Detect stated vs revealed preference)
- **Protocol 197**: Consigliere Mode (Stress-test via Devil's Advocate)
- **Protocol 75**: Compression-Expansion Cycle (Max 6 reasoning steps)

> ⚠️ These run **sequentially**, adding latency. Total: ~15-20 sec, not 5 sec.

### 3.3 RAG + Case Study Lookup

Retrieves prior solutions and adapts them. **This cannot solve truly novel problems.**

> ⚠️ **Failure Mode**: If no Case Study matches but system returns one anyway, it will force-fit an irrelevant pattern. This is a **hallucination risk**.

## 4. Failure Detection (Current State: Manual)

**Honest Status**: We do NOT have automatic failure detection.

- `/ultrathink` is triggered **manually by the user**.
- COS perspectives can confidently agree on **wrong answers**.
- No uncertainty quantification is implemented.

**Proposed Fix** (Not Yet Implemented):

- If COS seats diverge >0.6 on disagreement scorer → Auto-trigger `/ultrathink`
- If RAG returns no match above 0.7 similarity → Warn user "No pattern found"

## 5. The "Schlep" Warning

Proxies often require **setup schlep** (e.g., manually tagging files, writing protocols) to avoid **runtime schlep** (slow queries, debugging complex DBs).
**We accept Setup Schlep to gain Runtime Speed.**

## 6. Verification: The Turing Test of Value

If the user cannot feel the difference in *outcome* between the Ideal and the Proxy, the Ideal is arguably **bloat**.
